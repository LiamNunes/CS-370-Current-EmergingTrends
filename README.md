# CS-370-Current-EmergingTrends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

On this project I implemented the code related to the Q-learing of the AI. I was given the code that dictated what the AI had to do and all of the code that revolved around the game itself. The only code I was responsible for creating and implementing was the code that directly trained the Intelligence Agent to run through the maze and learn from its previous runs.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

At their core, computer scientists solve problems. They do this by researching and design computer code to design programs that can solve a specific issue that they, or their client, might have. And in doing this they make life easier for anyone who has that problem. By learning from past problems and adapting those to current and future problems, Computer scientists are able to exponentially advance technology and solve problems no one though possible.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist my approach to solving problems is to make a plan. I look at the problem and break it up into smaller segments and how those segments have to interact. I then repeat that process until I canâ€™t break up the problem any more. Then based on what I have I make a plan and decide the order they need to be done and determine if the solution to any of those sub problems already exists, and if it does if I am able to utilize or adapt it.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer safety my primary concern for both my end user and my company are safely and security. It is my responsibility to ensure that my code cannot harm the company I am working for or the end user that is using my product. Additionally I am responsible for ensuring that no actors, bad or good, can get any information from my software that can be used to cause any harm to my company or my end user.
